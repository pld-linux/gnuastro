 Unlike the histogram which has a limited number of bins, ideally the cumulative frequency plot should have one point for every data element.
 Even in small datasets (for example a @mymath{200\times200} image) this will result in an unreasonably large number of points to plot (40000)! As a result, for practical reasons, it is common to only store its value on a certain number of points (intervals) in the input range rather than the whole dataset, so you should determine the number of bins you want when asking for a cumulative frequency plot.
