 Unlike the histogram which has a limited number of bins, ideally the cumulative frequency plot should have one point for every data element.
 Even in small datasets (for example a @mymath{200\times200} image) this will result in an unreasonably large number of points to plot (40000)! As a result, for practical reasons, it is common to only store its value on a certain number of points (intervals) in the input range rather than the whole dataset, so you should determine the number of bins you want when asking for a cumulative frequency plot.
 In Gnuastro (and thus the Statistics program), the number reported for each bin is the total number of data points until the larger interval value for that bin.

 Having constructed the PSF as described above (or by any other procedure), it can be scaled to the brightness of the various stars in the image to get subtracted (and thus remove the extended/bright wings; better showing the background objects of interest).
 Note that the absolute flux of a PSF is meaningless (and in fact, it is usually normalized to have a total sum of unity!), so it should be scaled.
 We therefore have another script that will calculate the scale (multiplication) factor of the PSF for each star.
